Covers circuits and circuit motifs in the brain that underlie computations like integration, decision-making, spatial navigation, inference, and other cognitive elements. Students study empirical results, build dynamical models of neural circuits, and examine the mathematical theory of representations and computation in such circuits. Considers noise, stability, plasticity, and learning rules for these systems. Students taking graduate version complete additional assignments. I. Fiete, A. Rebei",
